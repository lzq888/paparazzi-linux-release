All files in this directory are related to using aerocomm modules (4790 1x1 10mW here) with Paparazzi.
Aerocomm API is used for transmission GCS->aircraft and not used for aircraft->GCS.
Therefore, configuration should be appropriate at both ends.

These files are still for my own copy of paparazzi which stems from a bit old version.
Therefore, some integration into the new one is needed. I will do that as time permits, but if somebody else is willing to do that it would be great.

Currently aerocomm modules that I am using worked perfectly at MAV'08 in Agra, India, and contunye to work here in Tucson, AZ.
I am using 9600bps host to modem speeds ad it works great even with quaterwave whip antenna (just a piece of wire). Tested range was more than 1km.
Also, this modem worked at 3800bps for some hi-speed telemetry gathering and I used fullwave whip antenna. Range was about 50m, I didnt test more than that, it was not needed.
