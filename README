Intro
-----

Paparazzi is an attempt to develop a cheap fixed wing UAV (Unmanned Air
Vehicle).  As of today we have successfully flown autonomously several small
electro powered fixed wing aircraft (Twinstar, Microjet, ...).

Up to date informations are available from the wiki website

	paparazzi.enac.fr

and from the mailing list (http://savannah.nongnu.org/mail/?group=paparazzi)
and the IRC channel (freenode, #paparazzi).

Paparazzi for Linux
-------------------

These files are derived from the Paparazzi project and are intended to support
a Linux-based flight computer.

Information about this project, including supported hardware, can be found
at http://moreproductive.org/autopilot/

Directories quick and dirty description:
---------------------------------------

conf: the configuration directory (airframe, radio, ... descriptions).

data: where to put read-only data (e.g. maps, terrain elevation files, icons)

sw: software (onboard, ground station, simulation, ...)

var: products of compilation, cache for the map tiles, ...


Required Software
-----------------

Installation is described in the wiki (paparazzi.enac.fr/wiki/Installation).
For Debian or Ubuntu users, required packages are available at

	http://paparazzi.enac.fr/debian

Installation of the meta-package "paparazzi-dev" will install
everything needed to compile this project (if something is missing,
please ask) for simulation. "paparazzi-arm7" is required to compile
the code for the ARM based boards.

Compilation and demo simulation
-------------------------------

  1) "make" in the top directory to compile all the libraries and tools.

  2) "make AIRCRAFT=LINUXFC ap" will build the autopilot to run locally.

  3) "make AIRCRAFT=LINUXFC ap.upload" will, after a successful local build,
     run "make export". As defined in Makefile.portable, this will rsync
     the latest files to your flight computer.
